# Op.Haven

## Overview

Op.Haven is a modified vault inspired by ERC-4326, offering enhanced features tailored for specific use cases. This smart contract-based project enables owners to deposit ERC-20 tokens and mint ownership tokens (bearing tokens) for designated recipients. Notably, bearing tokens have restricted transferability and can only be sent to whitelisted addresses.

The project is designed to facilitate controlled access to original ERC-20 tokens corresponding to the earned bearing tokens. Owners can manage the process by setting daily withdrawal limits for whitelisted addresses. Additionally, the protocol incorporates small transaction fees to sustain its operations.

## Features

- **Deposits and Ownership Tokens:** Owners can deposit ERC-20 tokens and mint ownership tokens (bearing tokens) for specified recipients.

- **Restricted Transferability:** Bearing tokens can only be transferred to whitelisted addresses.

- **Redemption:** Whitelisted addresses with bearing tokens can redeem the original ERC-20 tokens.

- **Daily Withdrawal Limits:** Owners have the ability to set daily withdrawal limits for whitelisted addresses.

- **DAO Crowdfunding and Grants:** The protocol serves as a foundation for DAOs, allowing users to purchase voting tokens. These tokens act as quadratic voting tools and contribute to project funding.

- **Rug Pull Protection:** In the event of a potential rug pull, all users will have their tokens returned, fostering trust within the Optimism blockchain ecosystem.

## Deployment

The project has been successfully deployed on the Optimism blockchain.
